# National health and Nutrition Examination Survey Predictive Modeling Project

## Following analysis is conducted on member-level patient data captured from various data files containing information from demographics, diet, medical examination, medication, labs and patient surveys. 

## My goal is to identify a reasonable, severe, and impactable Outcome Measure, and conduct my work to understand the contributing factors to that outcome. 

## I will also attempt to un-earth the underlying relationships between the various data elements and data points using more advance machine learning methods

We can see that the dataframe has roughly 10,000 members, and just over 2,000 variables.
This poses a challenge in both seeing the content at a glance, as well as potential issues with modelig efforts such as colinearity.
I will attempt to reduce the number of variables using both clinical knowledge, and using methods to find significant factors.f
