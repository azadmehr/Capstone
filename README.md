# National health and Nutrition Examination Survey Predictive Modeling Project

## Following analysis is conducted on member-level patient data captured from various data files containing information from demographics, diet, medical examination, medication, labs and patient surveys. 

## - My goal is to identify a reasonable, severe, and impactable Outcome Measure, and conduct my work to understand the contributing factors to that outcome. 

## - I will also attempt to un-earth the underlying relationships between the various data elements and data points using more advance machine learning methods

## My code is broken down into EDA/Correlation study, Hypotheses Testing and Random Forest Classifiers to further understand my data.
## -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EDA and Correlation:

## Getting a sense for the data in terms of Age, Income, general metrics.

## Further exploring the variables due to their high number ~ 2,500 variables.
### This poses a challenge in both seeing the content at a glance, as well as potential issues with modelig efforts such as colinearity. So I attempt to reduce the number of variables using both clinical knowledge, and using methods to find significant factors. 

### I used histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, correlation matrices to study each variable as well as relationships between variables. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis helped me uncover a few different important variables, as well as to get a sense of attributes of the data such as age distribution
## -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hypothesis Testing:

## Upon finding interesting information such as correlation, I used Hypothesis testing and bootstrapping to determine if an observation was true or not. 

## -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Random Forest Classifiers:

## I first determined what clinically significant variables I care about. Then I used this modeling technique to see what underlying variables have significant correlation. 

# Among all the different analyses, I have a better sense of my variables and made significant progress toward reducing my number of variables that I want to use in further modeling efforts.
