# National health and Nutrition Examination Survey Predictive Modeling Project

## Following analysis is conducted on member-level patient data captured from various data files containing information from demographics, diet, medical examination, medication, labs and patient surveys. 

## My goal is to identify a reasonable, severe, and impactable Outcome Measure, and conduct my work to understand the contributing factors to that outcome. 

## I will also attempt to un-earth the underlying relationships between the various data elements and data points using more advance machine learning methods

## We saw that the dataframe has roughly 10,000 members, and just over 2,000 variables. 
### This poses a challenge in both seeing the content at a glance, as well as potential issues with modelig efforts such as colinearity. 
### I will attempt to reduce the number of variables using both clinical knowledge, and using methods to find significant factors. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis helped me uncover a few different important variables, as well as to get a sense of attributes of the data such as age distribution
